This is a modified abstract factory for creating form elements in php.

It was originally written for integration into a Joomla! component, hence the somewhat unwieldy interface.

This code was written for WAY Media, Inc. with the intention of being released to the open source community. Used with permission, released under the GPL.

The "backend" interface included was used in the backend of Joomla! in a mootools-powered interface for easily creating and editing forms. Fields could be renamed by clicking on the label and rearranged via drag and drop. Fields could be added or removed with a single click via ajax. name and id attributes were generated on the fly from the label text, though they could be edited manually where necessary.

I will try to recreate these features in the example code (test.php) in the near future.
